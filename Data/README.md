# Input data for multiple analysis in Garcia et al. 2024

This directory contains the datasets needed to conduct the analyses in our MS, currently available on BioRxiv as a preprint:

doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.27.559715

Clarifying notes:

- The dataset AllShapePhenotypicData.csv is an integration of the shape data in the folder shape_parameters and the phenotypes in the file "SkerryRawPhenotoypicData.xlsx"

- The files Tesselation.txt, Thickness.txt, Ridges.txt, and Beige.txt, were generated by summarizing the file "SkerryRawPhenotoypicData.xlsx"
