# Scripts to generate the Figure 1 in Garcia et al. 2024

This directory contains the scripts needed to generate the Figure 1 in our MS, currently available on BioRxiv as a preprint:

**Predicting rapid adaptation in time from adaptation in space: a 30-year field experiment in marine snails**

doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.27.559715

Clarifying notes:
- Main_Fig1.R is the main script, which imports the other scripts and call their functions. To generate Figure 1, just the Main_Fig1.R needs to be run and make sure all other scripts are available in the specified paths.
