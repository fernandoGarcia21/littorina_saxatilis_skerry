# Scripts to generate the Figure 2 in Garcia et al. 2024

This directory contains the scripts needed to generate the Figure 2 in our MS, currently available on BioRxiv as a preprint:

**Predicting rapid adaptation in time from adaptation in space: a 30-year field experiment in marine snails**

doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.27.559715

Clarifying notes:
- 1_Main_Fig2_A_D.R is the main script that generates the pannels A and D in the figure 2. This script imports other scripts and call their functions, for example to generate the Pie Chart and the Manhattan Plot. To generate Figure 2 panels A and D, just the 1_Main_Fig2_A_D.R needs to be run and make sure all other scripts are available in the specified paths.
- Pannels B and C are generated by the script 3_Fig_2BC_Space_Time_FST_Correlation.R. However, the input FST correlation files must be previously generated through the script 2_seqsnptm009_time vs space.R and must be available in the Data directory.
- Because of the large size of the file PAR001_freqs_ALL_13_all.txt, used in the script 2_seqsnptm009_time vs space.R, it will be available only upon request.
